# Hadamard
### A C++ Quantum Computer Simulator

Hadamard is an (in progress) quantum computer simulator. The goal of the project is to enable the creation of multi-qubit quantum circuits using a universal set of quantum gates. The project includes tools for manipulating complex numbers, vectors, matrices (including operations and representations for unitary and hermitian matrices). Eventually, the goal is to include visualizations including that of a Bloch sphere to demonstrate the effect each quantum operation has on a qubit's state
